# OS
My hobby bootloader with small assembly program that prints itself on screen in hexadecimal notation.

Dependencies: ld, nasm, clang, ddrelease64, objcopy, qemu or virtualbox machine.
Worked properly on my unused laptop and old desktop pc.
DO NOT TRY TO RUN IT ON YOUR HARDWARE.
Build script is for Windows systems and it requires your own edits to it.
